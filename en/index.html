        Nowadays memes are a bery popular medium on and off the Internet. The goal of this website is to analyze and summarize this medium in more or less symple terms.
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl">What is a Meme?</h2>
        <br>
        A Meme is usually an image, Video, or GIF, which portrays a situation and contains some sort of text which provides either real or fictional, 
        but almost never the situation's original context.
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl">Good description, but why would you go through the trouble of creating such a "Meme" in the first place?</h2>
        <br>
        Well, at the end of the day, unlike websites, whose original purpose was to relay information (and not to scam some old lady off her mortgage), 
        memes' purpose is to relay feelings! Take a realistic example:
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="m-auto relative w-full box-content">
            <br>
            <p id="meme_text">
                Me, working on this website (Its already 10 hours past the deadline)
                <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            </p>

        </div>
        As you can tell, the wojak (Yes, thats the name of the character. No, I dont know why his name is that.) is in the exact same situation as me 
        (You could say &quot;HES LITERALLY ME!!!&quot;).
        And while that piece of information isn't exactly important, the fact however that the wojak is just sitting there and working on his website in a 
        somewhat calm fashion even though he knows that what he delivered 10 hours ago wont be fixed even if he submits everything he did past that point, makes the image in my honest opinion quite funny.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl">Is that all? You created a whole-ass website just for this bullshit?</h2>
        <br>
        Yes, that is correct. And nowI want you to spend the next 15 minutes staring at the background. 
        I "invested" so much time into it, that you kind of owe me that. I mean, it was you who went on to visit this website in the first place.
        All of those memes where fetched from r/memes over on reddit as soon as you loaded the page.
        Of course, that doesnt mean that i dont have the sources for them :) (Even if they didnt even work when i submitted THIS BULLSHIT)
